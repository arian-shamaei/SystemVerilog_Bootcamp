## Important Note:

So at the same time learning systemVerilog, I am also learning how to use git and github. I have accidentally deleted half of my files for this project after I finished it (hence why half the files are not present). 

The 4-16 bcode wave file is still here as proof I completeld the full scope of this project.

I will properly update everything if I have the time. 

Sorry uwu
